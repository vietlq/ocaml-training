## Variations on a (key x value) table

* Build a quick-n-dirty on-disk (key x value) storage
* Make the value type polymorphic by requiring serializers
* Write an interface for it
* Write a simple in-memory storage
* Combine both into cached disk storage
* Make 3 implementations available as three modules with the same interface
