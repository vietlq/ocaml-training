## Labeled & Optional Arguments

### Labeled Arguments

Let's define a function that adds a prefix & a postfix to a string:

```ocaml
let delimit pre s post = pre ^ s ^ post
```

In the signature, it appears as:

```ocaml
val delimit : string -> string -> string -> string
(**
    [delimit pre s post] adds a prefix and a postfix to a string [s]
*)
```

We can see that the function is ambiguous and needs documentation in the form of comments.

An alternative definition using labels:

```ocaml
let delimit ~pre s ~post = pre ^ s ^ post
```

In signature, it appears as:

```ocaml
val delimit : pre:string -> string -> post:string -> string
```

Now it is much easier to read and comprehend the signature.

There are many ways to apply the function:

```ocaml
delimit "<" "xx" ">" ;;
delimit ~pre:"<" "xx" ~post:">" ;;
delimit ~post:"<" "xx" ~pre:">" ;;
delimit ~post:"<" ~pre:">" "xx" ;;
delimit "xx" ~post:"<" ~pre:">" ;;
```

**Note**:

* Labels can be omitted if all arguments are passed
* Labeled arguments can be put in any order, mixed with others
* Other arguments must be passed in declaration order

Partial application:

```ocaml
let prefix = delimit ~post:""
let postfix = delimit ~pre:""
let wrap = delimit ~pre:"(" ~post:")"
```

**Note:** Labels are required for partial application.

Simplification:

```ocaml
let pre = "<" and post = ">" in
delimit ~pre ~post "Great!"
```

### Optional Arguments

Let's write a function that concatenates the strings in a list with a separator:

```ocaml
let rec concat sep = function
    | [] -> ""
    | [single] -> single
    | word :: words -> word ^ sep ^ concat sep words
```

Many times when we want to join strings, we had to write in an ugly way: `concat "" strings`.

So there's a room for improvement and we should think of using optional arguments:

```ocaml
let concat ?sep strings =
    let rec aux strings =
        match strings, sep with
        | [], _ -> ""
        | [single], _ -> single
        | word :: words, Some sep -> word ^ sep ^ aux words
        | word :: words, None -> word ^ aux words
    in
    aux strings
```

There's a shorter version too:

```ocaml
let rec concat ?sep strings = match strings, sep with
    | [], _ -> ""
    | [single], _ -> single
    | word :: words, Some sep -> word ^ sep ^ concat words
    | word :: words, None -> word ^ concat words
```

Usage:

```ocaml
concat ["Hello" ; "World"] ;;
concat ~sep:", " ["Hello" ; "World"] ;;
concat ?sep:(Some ", ") ["Hello" ; "World"] ;;
```

We could get rid of the `option` types by providing a default value:

```ocaml
let rec concat ?(sep = "") = function
    | [] -> ""
    | [single] -> single
    | word :: words -> word ^ sep ^ concat ~sep words
```

Syntax:

* `~arg:val` passes an `'a` value in `var` to an optional argument `?arg:'a`
* `?arg:val` optionally passes an `'a option` to an argument `?arg:'a`
* `~pre:pre` simplifies to `~pre`
* `?arg:arg` simplifies to `?arg`

End of application:

* Application starts once a non-optional, non-labeled argument is passed
* Functions must have a non-optional argument after the optional ones
* A placeholder `()` can be used

The body is executed once the `()` is passed:

```
let translate ?x ?y ?z () = (* ... *)
```
