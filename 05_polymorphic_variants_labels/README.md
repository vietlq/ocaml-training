# Polymorphic Variants, Labels

## Labeled & Optional Arguments

### Labeled Arguments

Let's define a function that adds a prefix & a postfix to a string:

```ocaml
let delimit pre s post = pre ^ s ^ post
```

In the signature, it appears as:

```ocaml
val delimit : string -> string -> string -> string
(**
    [delimit pre s post] adds a prefix and a postfix to a string [s]
*)
```

We can see that the function is ambiguous and needs documentation in the form of comments.

An alternative definition using labels:

```ocaml
let delimit ~pre s ~post = pre ^ s ^ post
```

In signature, it appears as:

```ocaml
val delimit : pre:string -> string -> post:string -> string
```

Now it is much easier to read and comprehend the signature.

There are many ways to apply the function:

```ocaml
delimit "<" "xx" ">" ;;
delimit ~pre:"<" "xx" ~post:">" ;;
delimit ~post:"<" "xx" ~pre:">" ;;
delimit ~post:"<" ~pre:">" "xx" ;;
delimit "xx" ~post:"<" ~pre:">" ;;
```

**Note**:

* Labels can be omitted if all arguments are passed
* Labeled arguments can be put in any order, mixed with others
* Other arguments must be passed in declaration order

Partial application:

```ocaml
let prefix = delimit ~post:""
let postfix = delimit ~pre:""
let wrap = delimit ~pre:"(" ~post:")"
```

**Note:** Labels are required for partial application.

Simplification:

```ocaml
let pre = "<" and post = ">" in
delimit ~pre ~post "Great!"
```

### Optional Arguments

Let's write a function that concatenates the strings in a list with a separator:

```ocaml
let rec concat sep = function
    | [] -> ""
    | [single] -> single
    | word :: words -> word ^ sep ^ concat sep words
```

Many times when we want to join strings, we had to write in an ugly way: `concat "" strings`.

So there's a room for improvement and we should think of using optional arguments:

```ocaml
let concat ?sep strings =
    let rec aux strings =
        match strings, sep with
        | [], _ -> ""
        | [single], _ -> single
        | word :: words, Some sep -> word ^ sep ^ aux words
        | word :: words, None -> word ^ aux words
    in
    aux strings
```

There's a shorter version too:

```ocaml
let rec concat ?sep strings = match strings, sep with
    | [], _ -> ""
    | [single], _ -> single
    | word :: words, Some sep -> word ^ sep ^ concat words
    | word :: words, None -> word ^ concat words
```

Usage:

```ocaml
concat ["Hello" ; "World"] ;;
concat ~sep:", " ["Hello" ; "World"] ;;
concat ?sep:(Some ", ") ["Hello" ; "World"] ;;
```

We could get rid of the `option` types by providing a default value:

```ocaml
let rec concat ?(sep = "") = function
    | [] -> ""
    | [single] -> single
    | word :: words -> word ^ sep ^ concat ~sep words
```

Syntax:

* `~arg:val` passes an `'a` value in `var` to an optional argument `?arg:'a`
* `?arg:val` optionally passes an `'a option` to an argument `?arg:'a`
* `~pre:pre` simplifies to `~pre`
* `?arg:arg` simplifies to `?arg`

End of application:

* Application starts once a non-optional, non-labeled argument is passed
* Functions must have a non-optional argument after the optional ones
* A placeholder `()` can be used

The body is executed once the `()` is passed:

```ocaml
let translate ?x ?y ?z () = (* ... *)
```

## Polymorphic Variants

### Sum types with inferred definition

Basic use case: Introduce constructors without type definition:

```ocaml
let arrow : int -> [`Left | `Right | `Both] -> string = fun len head ->
    match head with
    | `Left -> "<" ^ String.make len '-'
    | `Right -> String.make len '-' ^ ">"
    | `Both -> "<" ^ String.make len '-' ^ ">"
```

Syntax:

* Constructors prefixed with a backquote `Constructor
* Type alias:

```ocaml
[`Constructor of type | `Constructor | ... ]
```

### Constructor sharing

Two polymorphic variant types can define the same constructor:

```ocaml
let arrow : int -> [`Left | `Right | `Both] -> string = fun len head ->
    match head with
    | `Left -> "<" ^ String.make len '-'
    | `Right -> String.make len '-' ^ ">"
    | `Both -> "<" ^ String.make len '-' ^ ">"

let parse_arrow_direction : char -> [`Left | `Right | `Knee] = function
    | '<' -> `Left
    | '>' -> `Right
    | _ -> `Knee

let arrow_from_direction dir =
    match parse_arrow_direction dir with
    | (`Left | `Right) as dir -> arrow 20 dir
    | `Knee -> failwith "in the knee"
```

The value `dir` is considered of both variant types and understood by both `parse_arrow_direction` and `arrow`.

### Subtyping

Intuitively, a polymorphic variant constructor:

* Can be seen as a singleton type *`U* is the only value of type ```[`U]```
* Can be included in bigger polymorphic variant types
* ```[`U | `V]``` is the union of singletons ```[`U]``` and ```[`V]```

This generalizes to a partial order (subtyping relation) order on variant types:

* ```[`U]``` is included in ```[`U | `V]```
* ```[`U | `V]``` is included in ```[`U | `V | `W]```
* ```[`U | `V]``` and ```[`V | `W]``` are not compatible

As with object, this is `structural typing`

* Polymorphic variant types do not need names
* Their type is their structure, not their name

The type system handles these subtyping relations, though row variables, as with objects.

In objects, the `..` only meant and possibly other method. For polymorphic variant types, more notations are available:

```ocaml
(* A type whose constructors are `U, `V and `W *)
[`U | `V | `W]

(* A type whose constructors are at least `U, `V and `W *)
[> `U | `V | `W]

(* A type whose constructors are at most `U, `V and `W *)
[< `U | `V | `W]

(* A type whose constructors are `U, `V and optionally `W *)
[< `U | `V | `W > `U | `V | ]
```

Intuition:

* The form ```[< `U | `V | `W]``` is used for expected values

```ocaml
let f : [< `U | `V | `W] list -> unit = fun l ->
    List.iter (function `U -> () | `V -> () | `W -> ()) l
let () = f ([`U ; `U] : `U list)
```

* The value passed may be always `U
* But it may never be `Z
* This is called a `covariant` position

* The form ```[> `U | `V | `W]``` is used for result values

```ocaml
let l : [> `U | `W] = [`U ; `W]
List.iter (function `U -> () | `V -> () | `W -> ()) l
```

* Not treating a value ``` `U, `V or `W ``` would cause an error
* You can try and treat any other constructor safely
* This is called a `contravariant` position

OCaml always infers the most generic type, including row variables and their variance.

This is easily verified with pattern matching:

```ocaml
let f = function `X -> `A | `Y -> `B
```

Is inferred to be of type:

```ocaml
[< `X | `Y] -> [> `A | `B]
```

If the type is too generic, one can refine it with:

* A checked annotation:

```ocaml
let f : [`X | `Y] -> [`A | `B]
    = function `X -> `A | `Y -> `B
```

* An interface:

```ocaml
module M :
sig
    val f : [`X] -> [`A | `B]
end = struct
    let f = function `X -> 'A | `Y -> `B
end
```

For instance if ``` `Y ``` is reserved for module internal use

* A type coercion:

```ocaml
let u = (`U :> [`U | `V])
```

### Aliases

Polymorphic variant types can be named:

```ocaml
type xyz = [`X | `Y | `Z]
```

These names can be used:

* As any other type alias
* Prefixed with a hash to open the type `#xyz` means ``` [> `X | `Y | `Z] ```
* In other variant definitions: ``` type wxyz = [`W | xyz] ```
* In match cases as a shortcut for all constructors: ``` match v with #xyz -> () ```

## Patterns

### Split & join cases

Suppose we have an expression type with operators over bools and ints.

```ocaml
type expr =
    [ `And of bool * bool
    | `Not of bool
    | `Add of int * int
    | `Neg of int ]
```

We can write two dedicated evaluation functions for clarity:

```ocaml
let eval_bool_op = function
    | `And (x, y) -> x && y
    | `Not x -> not x

let eval_int_op = function
    | `Add (x, y) -> x + y
    | `Neg x -> - x
```

Their signatures:

```ocaml
val eval_bool_op : [< `And of bool * bool | `Not of bool ] -> bool

val eval_int_op : [< `Add of int * int | `Neg of int ] -> int
```

We then could join & split cases:

```ocaml
let eval_op = function
    | `And _ | `Not _ as bool_op -> `Bool (eval_bool_op bool_op)
    | `Add _ | `Neg _ as int_op -> `Int (eval_int_op int_op)
```

The function above has the signature:

```ocaml
val eval_op :
  [< `Add of int * int | `And of bool * bool | `Neg of int | `Not of bool ] ->
  [> `Bool of bool | `Int of int ]
```

### Objects, Labels & Variants

Object oriented APIs can be made more appealing with this combination. One of the goal is to simulate constructor overloading. E.g.:

```ocaml
class hbox :
    ?spacing:int ->
    ?homogeneous:bool ->
    ?vertical_align: [< `Top | `Bottom | `Center | `Fill]
    #component list -> component
```

### Phantom types with variant tags

Phantom type parameters are ones that unused in the definition. Using module abstraction, these variables can be forced. This is used to encode human checked typing properties.

See `TyXML` that encodes XHTML well-formedness this way.

A library for classifying ints:

```ocaml
module Checked_string : sig
    type +'a t
    val positive : int -> [> `P] t
    val negative : int -> [> `N] t
    val (mod) : [< `P] t -> [< `P] t -> [> `P] t
    val abs : [< `P | `N] t -> [> `P] t
    val to_int : [< `P | `N] t
end = struct
    type 'a t = int
    let positive n = if n < 0 then invalid_arg "positive" else n
    let negative n = if n > 0 then invalid_arg "negative" else n
    let (mod) x n = x mod n
    let abs n = abs n
    let to_int n = n
end
```

Property: Once an integer is classified, all operations on it won't fail.
